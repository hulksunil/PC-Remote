### Client

**Android (APK release)**  
```bash
flutter build apk --release
# Output path: build/app/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

**iOS (release / archive)**  
For quick testing:
```bash
flutter run --release
```
For App Store or TestFlight distribution, use Xcode to archive and upload the iOS build.

## Troubleshooting

- **Poor Wi-Fi connectivity**
  - Use a reserved/static IP for the server or try using your phone as a hotspot.
  - If you suspect router compatibility issues, try disabling Wi-Fi 6 or move to a stronger network point.
  - Ensure both devices are on the same network (same subnet).

- **Device not showing in Flutter / Xcode**
  - Run `flutter devices` to list connected devices.
  - Revoke/re-grant trust between phone and computer if necessary.
  - Ensure developer mode / USB debugging is enabled on the phone.

- **Server not visible on network**
  - On Windows, verify the network profile is **Private** (not Public) so the PC is discoverable.
  - Confirm any firewall rules allow the server port(s) you use (TCP/UDP).

- **App networking seems unstable**
  - Check for multiple overlapping Wi-Fi bands (2.4GHz vs 5GHz) causing devices to switch networks.
  - Try turning off VPNs or network managers that might block local traffic.

## Notes

- The app has been tested primarily on local networks; most issues reported are due to network configuration, not the app itself.
- For development, `flutter run` and `go run .` are sufficient. Use `flutter build` / `go build` for production/release binaries.
- If you add or change dependencies, run `go mod tidy` (server) and `flutter pub get` (client) to sync modules.
